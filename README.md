kata-test-framework-js
======================

The framework used by Codewars for testing kata


### About
This repository has been added so that Codewars users can view the code used for testing JavaScript and CoffeeScript kata. 
It is a part of an initiative to open-source a portion of the site. This version of the framework is almost identical to the
one used on the site, with only a few security related lines of code removed. This code is not designed to be used in any other 
context other than on Codewars.

### Contributions
The purpose of this repo is to allow other developers the opportunity to contribute to the kata framework. Any optimizations or additions are welcome. 

The workflow is:

- Fork this repo
- Make optimizations or additions to the code base
- Submit pull-request

Not all pull-requests will be accepted, due mostly to size constrictions. Ideally this framework should be kept as small as possible. Once
a pull-request is accepted it will need to be manually merged into the actual Codewars codebase by someone on the Codewars team.
